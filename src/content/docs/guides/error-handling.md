description: How KwesPay reports failures in the SDK, the widget and the GraphQL API, and how to recover from expired quotes, wallet rejections, network mismatches and API errors.

Failures come from three places: the KwesPay API, the customer's wallet and the chain. The SDK turns all of them into a `KwesPayError` with a `code`.

```ts
import { KwesPayError } from "@kwespay/client";

try {
  const payload = await kwespay.quote(params);
  await kwespay.pay({ provider, payload, onStatus });
} catch (err) {
  if (!(err instanceof KwesPayError)) throw err;

  switch (err.code) {
    case "WALLET_REJECTED":
    case "APPROVAL_REJECTED":
      showMessage("Payment cancelled in your wallet.");
      break;
    case "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE":
      showMessage("Not enough funds for the payment and network fee.");
      break;
    case "QUOTE_EXPIRED":
    case "QUOTE_USED":
      showMessage("The price expired. Please try again.");
      break;
    case "NETWORK_NOT_ENABLED":
    case "TOKEN_NOT_SUPPORTED":
    case "MERCHANT_NOT_FOUND":
      reportConfigurationProblem(err);
      break;
    default:
      reportError(err.code, err.message);
  }
}
```

The full list is in [SDK error codes](/sdk/errors/).

## Recovering from common failures

| Situation | Code | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The customer declined in the wallet | `WALLET_REJECTED`, `APPROVAL_REJECTED` | Let them try again with the same payload if it has not expired |
| Quote older than 10 minutes | `QUOTE_EXPIRED` | Call `quote()` again. Never reuse quote IDs |
| Quote already turned into a transaction | `QUOTE_USED` | Call `quote()` again |
| Wallet on another chain and switching failed | `WRONG_NETWORK` | Ask the customer to add or select the network in their wallet |
| Not enough tokens or gas | `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Show the required amount from `totalBaseUnits` and the network's fee token |
| Network not enabled for the merchant | `NETWORK_NOT_ENABLED` | Enable it in the dashboard, or stop offering it. Use `getMerchantConfig()` to build your options |
| Token not available for the merchant or network | `TOKEN_NOT_SUPPORTED` | As above |
| API unreachable or HTTP error | `NETWORK_ERROR` | Retry with backoff. HTTP 429 means you exceeded 200 requests per minute |
| On-chain call reverted or timed out | `CONTRACT_ERROR` | Read `err.message`. Do not retry the same payload if the transaction may have been mined. Check the status first |

## Errors from the GraphQL API

The API reports problems in two ways. See [API errors](/api/errors/).

- `createQuote` and `createTransaction` always return data. Failures come back as `success: false` with a human-readable `message`.
- Other operations, such as `getTransactionStatus` and `submitTransactionHash`, return a GraphQL `errors` array, for example `Transaction not found`.

The SDK maps `message` text to codes by keyword, so treat `err.message` as the detail and `err.code` as the category. Show your own wording to customers.

## Do not double-charge

If `pay()` throws after the wallet broadcast the transaction, for example a timeout while waiting for the receipt, the payment may still succeed. Before you let the customer pay again:

1. Read the status of `payload.transactionReference`.
2. If it is `processing`, wait and check again.
3. Only start a new quote if the transaction never reached the chain, or the status is `expired` or `failed` and its `blockchainHash` shows no successful payment.

The contract rejects a second payment with the same payment ID, so retrying the **same** payload cannot charge twice. A **new** quote can.
