description: Decide whether an order is paid with one verifyPayment call that checks on-chain confirmation, the order, the amount and the currency for you.

Before you ship goods, grant access or mark an invoice paid, confirm the payment on your server. There are two ways, and most integrations use both:

- **[Webhooks](/guides/webhooks/)**: KwesPay calls your server when the payment settles, even if the customer closed the page.
- **`verifyPayment`**: your server asks KwesPay about a reference whenever it needs to, for example when a browser reports one or during reconciliation.

One `verifyPayment` call does every check:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { KwesPayClient } from "@kwespay/client";

const kwespay = new KwesPayClient({ apiKey: process.env.KWESPAY_API_KEY! });

const check = await kwespay.verifyPayment(reference, {
  orderId: order.id,
  amount: order.total,
  currency: order.currency,
});

if (check.paid) {
  await markOrderPaid(order.id, reference);
} else {
  console.log(check.status, check.reason);
}
```

From any other language, send the [`verifyPayment`](/api/operations/verify-payment/) query with your API key in `X-API-Key`.

## What `paid: true` means

KwesPay returns `paid: true` only when all of these hold:

| Check | Fails with |
| --- | --- |
| The payment belongs to a merchant your API key can access | `Transaction not found` |
| It was created for `orderId` | "This payment belongs to a different order." |
| It was priced in `currency` | "This payment was priced in GHS, not USD." |
| It was priced at `amount`, to within half a cent | "This payment was for 1, not 120." |
| KwesPay confirmed it on-chain as `completed` or `overpaid` | "The payment has not been confirmed on-chain yet." |

`amount` and `currency` are required, so a cheaper payment can never be accepted for a more expensive order. `orderId` works when checkout was opened with the same `orderId`. Without it, store the reference with the order and accept each reference for one order only.

Before answering, KwesPay checks the chain for payments that are still `processing`, so a call made right after the customer pays returns the current state.

## Where the reference comes from

| Integration | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| HTML embed | `event.detail.transactionReference` from the button's `kwespay:result` event |
| Widget | `payment.transactionReference` from `kwespay()` |
| SDK | `result.transactionReference` from `checkout()` |

The browser hands you the reference, but only `verifyPayment` tells you whether it is paid. A reference typed into a URL, or a result edited in the browser console, fails the check.

## When it is not paid yet

| `status` | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `pending`, `processing` | Not confirmed yet. Check again shortly, or from a scheduled job for orders still waiting |
| `underpaid` | Less than the quoted amount arrived. Hold the order for review |
| `overpaid` | More arrived. `paid` is `true`. Refund the difference if your policy says so |
| `expired` | No payment was recorded in time. If `txHash` is set, look it up before cancelling |
| `failed`, `refunded` | Do not fulfil |

See [Payment statuses](/merchants/payment-statuses/) for the full lifecycle.

## How KwesPay confirms

1. When the wallet broadcasts the payment, the widget and SDK report the transaction hash and the status becomes `processing`.
2. KwesPay reads the payment contract's events and waits for the configured confirmations.
3. It compares the amount the merchant received with the quote. A difference of up to 0.1% is `completed`. A larger one is `underpaid` or `overpaid`.
4. Quotes and transactions that were never paid expire.

Only KwesPay's chain listeners can set `completed`, `underpaid` or `overpaid`. No client and no dashboard action can.
