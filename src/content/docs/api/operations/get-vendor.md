  getVendor(vendorIdentifier: $vendorIdentifier): Vendor
}

| Type | Query |
| Auth | None |
| SDK | [`getMerchantConfig()`](/sdk/methods/#getmerchantconfig) |

Returns the merchant's payment configuration, or `null` if the vendor ID does not exist.

## Fields used by integrations

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vendorIdentifier` | `String!` | Vendor ID |
| `businessName` | `String!` | Display name |
| `acceptedCurrencies` | `[String!]!` | Token symbols the merchant accepts |
| `enabledNetworks` | `[String!]!` | Network keys the merchant has enabled |
| `hasEvmWallet` | `Boolean!` | An EVM receiving wallet is set |
| `hasSuiWallet` | `Boolean!` | A Sui receiving wallet is set |
| `hasStellarWallet` | `Boolean!` | A Stellar receiving wallet is set |
| `activeStatus` | `Boolean!` | The merchant can accept payments |

A network is usable only when it is enabled, the merchant has a wallet of its family, and at least one accepted token is offered on it. `getMerchantConfig()` in the SDK computes this for you.

## Example

```graphql
query {
  getVendor(vendorIdentifier: "YOUR_VENDOR_ID") {
    businessName
    acceptedCurrencies
    enabledNetworks
    hasEvmWallet
    hasStellarWallet
    activeStatus
  }
}
```

An unknown vendor ID returns `{ "data": { "getVendor": null } }`.
